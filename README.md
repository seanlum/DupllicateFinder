## This tool is in early stages of development

### Libraries currently used:
- File and directory traversal: (`Python3/Lib/os`)
- File hashing: (`Python3/Lib/hashlib`)
- JSON output: (`Python3/Lib/json`)

### Goals:
- PyQT5 GUI Bindings (`pyqt5`)
- SQLite Database Storage (`Python3/Lib/sqlite3/`)
- JSON as Temp Cache Data (`refactor on using Python3/Lib/json`)
- Regular Expression search capabilities (`Python3/Lib/re`)
